/*
18. Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form

									ax2 + bx + c = 0

If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. Remember,
researching how to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to
solve it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c. Since there are two solutions to a quadratic
equation, output both x1 and x2.
