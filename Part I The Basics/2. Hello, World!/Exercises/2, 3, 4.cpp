2.Expanding on what you have learned, write a program that lists the instructions for a computer
o find the upstairs bathroom, discussed in §2.1. Can you think of any more steps that a person would
assume, but that a computer would not? Add them to your list. This is a good start in “thinking like a
computer.” Warning: For most people, “go to the bathroom” is a perfectly adequate instruction. For someone
with no experience with houses or bathrooms (imagine a stone-age person, somehow transported into your dining room)
the list of necessary instructions could be very long. Please don’t use more than a page. For the benefit of
the reader, you may add a short description of the layout of the house you are imagining.

// Exercise 3 and exercise 4 are pretty much same with exercise 2. So i wont create code for them, if you want to do it you gotta write lots of cout s :D

3. Write a description of how to get from the front door of your dorm room, apartment, house, whatever,
to the door of your classroom (assuming you are attending some school; if you are not, pick another target).
Have a friend try to follow the instructions and annotate them with improvements as he or she goes along.
To keep friends, it may be a good idea to “field test” those instructions before giving them to a friend.

4. Find a good cookbook. Read the instructions for baking blueberry muffins (if you are in a country where “blueberry muffins” is a strange,
exotic dish, use a more familiar dish instead). Please note that with a bit of help and instruction, most of the people in the world can bake
delicious blueberry muffins. It is not considered advanced or difficult fine cooking. However, for the author, few exercises in this book are
as difficult as this one. It is amazing what you can do with a bit of practice.
• Rewrite those instructions so that each individual action is in its own numbered paragraph. Be careful to list all ingredients
and all kitchen utensils used at each step. Be careful about crucial details, such as the desired oven temperature, preheating the oven,
the preparation of the muffin pan, the way to time the cooking, and the need to protect your hands when removing the muffins from the oven.
• Consider those instructions from the point of view of a cooking novice (if you are not one, get help from a friend who does not know how to cook).
Fill in the steps that the book’s author (almost certainly an experienced cook) left out for being obvious.
• Build a glossary of terms used. (What’s a muffin pan? What does preheating do? What do you mean by “oven”?)
• Now bake some muffins and enjoy your results.
